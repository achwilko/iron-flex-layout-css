# iron-flex-layout-css
CSS extract (without vendor prefixes) from Google's &lt;iron-flex-layout> web component that provides simple ways to use CSS flexible box layout. It's really an easy and efficient way to build any kind of layout.

## Reason
Custom elements cannot import external stylesheets using the "usual way" (&lt;link rel="stylesheet">) because that does not work in the shadow DOM (find more details [here](https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-flex-layout/issues/88)).

## Guides
